### Hello Fellow Coders ðŸ‘‹
You can call me Andrew, Drew or Drewskii. I have been coding since I was building websites in HTML at 13. From there I studied Computer Science in college and took on iOS development which I never seemed to have gotten away from.

- ðŸ”­ Currently, I am working on my own iOS applications (VaultPass and ComicFans) that are now in the App Store.
  
- ðŸŒ± I am expanding my knowledge by discovering new skills and technologies, contributing to open source projects, and playing with the new Raspberry Pi 5.
  
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love basketball and gaming on my non-coding free time.

- ðŸ’¬ Reach out, ask me anything - codehacker.andrew@gmail.com
