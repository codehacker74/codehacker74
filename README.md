### Hi Friends 👋
You can call me Andrew, Drew or Drewskii. I have been coding since I was 13 building websites in HTML. From there I studied Computer Science in college and took on iOS development which I never seemed to have gotten away from.

- 🔭 Currently, I am working on my own iOS applications (VaultPass and ComicFans) that are now in the App Store.
  
- 🌱 I am expanding my knowledge by writing compilers, looking to contribute to open source projects, and purchasing the new Raspberry Pi 5 to play with.
  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love basketball and gaming on my non-coding free time.

- 📫 Reach out to me -> codehacker.andrew@gmail.com
  
- 💬 Ask me anything.
